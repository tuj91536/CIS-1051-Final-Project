# Proposal
Make a maze game where the player is prompted to make choices
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Not sure for now

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
Our video game will be a maze game where the player has to make choices between two or more options and only one is correct.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
Our game will be made in Unity and it will mainly use if statements to determine that outcome based on what path through the maze the player chooses. Wrong choices will set the player back and correct choices will help the player advance through the maze. We are still working on learning Unity so part of this project will be learning how to correctly use Unity.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
Not planning to combine with another final.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Ryan Allen and Joseph Lynch
Ryan's email is tuk48200@temple.edu and Joe's email is tug79835@temple.edu
All of us are in lab section 7 with TA Joanne.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
Maze is non-randomize, but has a correct path that the player can follow to reach the end, and there will also be a victory screen when the player gets to the end

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
All of the elements from the good outcome with the addition of a time limit that the player has to reach the end of the maze within and have some sort of music playing in the background of the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
All of the elements from the good and better outcomes, and there will be an enemy added and the maze path will be randomized every time so that each time the player plays the game the experience will be unique and the correct path will be different. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We will need to learn to use Unity properly and learn to use c#. Unity has tutorials for getting familiar with using it, so doing some of those will be helpful. Once we are familiar enough with Unity and c# to begin making the game. One of us will work on making the character and movement, another of us will work on designing the maze, and another of us will work on the outcomes for different choices. Once we accomplish all of that, we will continue to divide up the work from the better and best sections.
